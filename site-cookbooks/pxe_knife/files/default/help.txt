:ii Network boot system
---------------------
If setup Windows XP and it's associated software, you are not allowed
to share the Windows install CD with others.

If install Linux, you are both encouraged and have the freedom to share
with the world. But, deepending on how technical you are, it can be
somewhat daunting (at least at first).

If install everything needed to become an :ii 'super computer', this
computer will be able to create more 'normal' windows and linux computers
as well as being able to create more 'super computers'.
We finally have a computer infrastructure that can bootstrap itself!
