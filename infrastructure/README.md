Infrastructure
========

You can use these scripts to bring up chef-server... then provision
the chef-server as a client back to itself, so you can use the
role[pxe-server].


Current State
==========

I've tried both, and use purge between the two, but more testing would
be appreciated.


Next Steps
==========

Maybe bootstrap on windows?
